Problem Statement:
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Solution:
public int maxProfit(int[] prices) 
    {
        int max_profit=0,min=prices[0];
        for(int i=0;i<prices.length;++i)
        {
            if(prices[i]<min)
                min=prices[i];
            if(prices[i]-min>max_profit)
                max_profit=prices[i]-min;
        }
        return max_profit;
    }
